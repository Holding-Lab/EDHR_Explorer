# EDHR_Explorer

A Shiny App hosted at [https://holding-lab.shinyapps.io/edhr_explorer/] to help explore the data from our ER HIF dataset.

Original data can be found in the repository supporting our publication [https://github.com/Holding-Lab/ER-HIF]. While it is unlikely to have resulted in any changes to the results, this data has been further processed for the web to work within the limiations of ShinyApps.io, the original publicaton data should therefore be seen as authorative.
